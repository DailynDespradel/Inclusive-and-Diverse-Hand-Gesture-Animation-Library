# Inclusive-and-Diverse-Hand-Gesture-Animation-Library

I (alongside Matthew Weber) have developed an inclusive and diverse hand gesture animation library designed for researchers conducting EMG hand gesture recognition experiments. This library empowers participants by allowing them to choose how they are represented during experimental sessions, promoting personalization and giving them a voice in the process.

The animations were created using three key tools: MakeHuman, Blender, and Krita. MakeHuman enabled the selection of models with the appropriate gender, age, and ethnicity. Blender was used for precise rigging and animation, focusing on wrist and finger movements. Finally, Krita was employed to convert these animations into Graphics Interchange Format (GIFs) for seamless integration into graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
